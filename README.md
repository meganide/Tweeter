I learned how to implement user authentication with JWT and improve my skills in creating reusable components in React, including custom hooks. I also gained a deeper understanding of the full-stack development process, from designing and setting up the database with Prisma to building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js and creating a user-friendly interface with React and Tailwind.

I improved my skills in front-end development, including building responsive layouts and adding various styles. I also gained experience in integrating various technologies to ensure they work together seamlessly.

TypeScript helped me improve the overall reliability and maintainability of my code. I also got to practice making the web application more user-friendly by adding various filters and a dark/light theme, making the app more customizable to the user's preferences.

In conclusion, developing this full-stack tweeter application allowed me to gain a wide range of skills and experience in various technologies, as well as a deeper understanding of how web applications are built from end-to-end.
